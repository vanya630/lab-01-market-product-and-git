# My role and skills

## My role
**Frontend Developer**

I chose this role because:
1. I enjoy creating interactive and visually appealing user interfaces.
2. I already have experience with HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript from university projects.
3. The role offers a clear learning path with abundant resources and community support.

## Skills I already have
- **HTML/CSS** – Advanced: built multiple responsive websites using semantic markup and Flexbox/Grid.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Intermediate: comfortable with DOM manipulation, async/await, and modules.
- **React** – Beginner: completed a small todo app; understand components and state basics.
- **Git** – Intermediate: use daily for personal and academic projects.
- **Chrome DevTools** – Intermediate: debug layout issues and performance bottlenecks regularly.

## Skills I clearly lack
- **TypeScript** – Essential for modern React apps in professional environments; improves code reliability.
- **State management (Redux/Zustand)** – Needed for complex data flows in large applications.
- **Testing (Jest, React Testing Library)** – Critical for maintainable code but not covered in my courses.
- **Build tools (Vite, Webpack)** – Required to optimize and bundle frontend assets efficiently.
- **Accessibility (a11y) standards** – Often overlooked by beginners but legally and ethically important.

Most challenging: **Webpack configuration** — steep learning curve due to abstract concepts like loaders and plugins.

## Skills that appear in several postings
1. **React** – 6/7 postings  
2. **TypeScript** – 5/7 postings  
3. **Git** – 5/7 postings  
4. **Testing (Jest/RTL)** – 4/7 postings  
5. **REST API integration** – 4/7 postings  

## Skills specific to a single posting
- **Vue.js** – only in SberDevices posting (likely legacy or team-specific stack)
- **GraphQL** – only at Avito (modern data-fetching trend)
- **Storybook** – only at Avito (component-driven development)
- **Lighthouse** – only at Avito (performance auditing tool)

These seem like either niche preferences or signs of forward-looking engineering practices.

## My skills and market demands
I realize that while I know the fundamentals, most real job postings expect TypeScript and testing experience — which I currently lack. My HTML/CSS and basic React are solid starting points, but without TypeScript, I’m not competitive even for junior roles at major companies. Also, I’ve never written a unit test for a UI component, which appears standard now. This gap is fixable, but I need to prioritize it.

## Skills that I can improve
1. **TypeScript** – I’ll add type annotations to my next React project and follow the official handbook.
2. **React Testing Library** – I’ll write tests for every new component I build.

These are realistic goals for one semester. I’ll use freeCodeCamp, roadmap.sh, and practice on small GitHub projects.
